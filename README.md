# bls_algeria_appointment_scripts

In this repository, I will upload all my scripts that I use to **book a BLS Algeria appointment automatically**.

---

## 💡 Why did I create this script?

- It's really hard to get an appointment at BLS centers these days, especially for Algeria 🇩🇿.  
- Appointments appear for a few seconds and disappear again for weeks.  
- Without an automation script, it's almost impossible to catch a free slot in time.  
- So I decided to make this public to help others who face the same issue. 😉

## ⚙️ How to use it?

1. Install **Source Code From Developer** Chrome extension.  
2. Select a script in this repo that you wish to use (for BLS Algeria).  
3. Copy the source code.  
4. Open Tampermonkey in your browser and click the **“Add Script”** tab (icon with a plus ➕ symbol).  
5. Paste the code inside the new script window and hit **Save**.  
6. Enjoy automated checking — use responsibly.
